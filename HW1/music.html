        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
                    <img src="assets/soundtrack.png" alt="Soundtrack" />

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The cover art for the soundtrack gives a pretty cool
                    representation of the game itself. On the left it shows
                    the world when Link is young, the middle shows both young and old
                    link, and the right shows the world when link is old.

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <h2>Title Track</h2>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHsAFs7w3ro"></iframe>

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    This first song is a very important addition to the list.
                    It's the first thing you hear waiting on the title screen
                    when you enter the game for the first time.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <h2>Hyrule Field</h2>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KkkZcqkShCA"></iframe>

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Hyrule field is an easy addition to the list as you hear this
                    song a lot throughout the game. You frequently enter Hyrule Field
                    to travel to each area, so this song will get stuck in your head quickly.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <h2>Zelda's Theme</h2>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OtDwn34iWY"></iframe>

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The last song I've included is Zelda's Theme.
                    This is a song that follows you throughout the game. You're
                    going to have to play Zelda's Lullaby on your ocarina many times,
                    and this song has a fully mixed version of that.

                    <br />
