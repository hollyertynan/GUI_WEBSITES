        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <!-- North American Box Art -->
                    <h2>North American Box Art</h2>
                    <img src="assets/na_box.jpg" alt="North American Box Art" />

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The North American box art is what we could find on the shelves here back in
                    1998. This is the box art I personally grew up with. This is also the
                    image displayed on the game cartridge.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <!-- European Box Art -->
                    <h2>European Box Art</h2>
                    <img src="assets/eu_box.jpg" alt="European Box Art" />

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The European box art is almost the same as the North American box art
                    just with a different color pallet. While I do think the color pallet is
                    better than the North American one, I do think the all gold shown
                    leaves out some color detailing.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    <!-- Japanese Box Art -->
                    <h2>Japanese Box Art</h2>
                    <img src="assets/jp_box.jpg" alt="Japanese Box Art" />

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    The Japanese box art is the most unique of the three. The boxes the
                    N64 games came in in Japan are also vertical rather than horizontal.
                    This features the same logo as the North American one, however with
                    a completely different background image.

                </td>
            </tr>

        </table>
    </body>
